Always read and orient around "prime-directive.md".

Never git commit for me unless I explicitly ask you to.

Never run the dev environment unless I explicitly ask you to.

NEVER start live processes (npm start, npm run, node, etc.) that call external APIs or run indefinitely. Instead:
1. Tell the user the command to run
2. Ask them to paste the output back
3. Analyze the results they provide
This prevents accidental API costs and zombie processes.
